The snd_pcm... functions are from the ALSA library. These are the functions
that actually find the microphone.

This code simply opens up the microphone right now. It immediately closes it
too, so I added a delay with for loops. It is nothing special at all but it
gives me a chance to use something like PulseAudio Volume Control to view the actual
opened recording device. Like I said I will continue to look into recording
and translating the data for the snack sound object.
